# Merkle Tree

Merkle tree is a tree in which every non-leaf node is labeled with the hash of the labels of its children nodes. Hash trees are useful because they allow efficient and secure verification of the contents of large data structures. Hash trees are a generalization of hash lists and hash chains. Demonstrating that a leaf node is a part of the given hash tree requires processing an amount of data proportional to the logarithm of the number of nodes of the tree. The concept of hash trees is named after Ralph Merkle who patented it in 1979.
